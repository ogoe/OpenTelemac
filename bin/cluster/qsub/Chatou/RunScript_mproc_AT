# Generation of scripts based on the telemac's architecture and
# on the PBS system. Those scripts are inspired by scripts
# written by Hugues Prisker and Tanguy Courau.
# The principle looks like: a file called $jobname is created and
# submitted by the following command: qsub -a $ddate $jobname
#
# Inputs are:
#   -the name of the job (jobname),
#   -the number of processors (nbnodes),
#   -the code to be used (codename),
#   -the name of the case (casename)
#   -and the time where the job starts (ddate)

# The script $jobname starts here and looks as follows:
#
# 1- PBS commands to assign the name and the number of processors
#    (in this case, it is possible to send jobs on only one processor).
#    Activation of the walltime in case of long jobs on 1 processor.
# 2- Definition/prompt of the Working Directory.
# 3- Evaluation of NP as the processor number. It is obtained by counting
#    the number of lines in the file containing the processor list.
# 4- Deletion of mpirun.txt and mpi_telemac.conf.
# 5- Copy of the file containing the processor name list ($PBS_NODEFILE),
#    into mpirun.txt.
# 6- Construction of mpi_telemac.conf by concatenation of the file
#    containing the number of processors and mpirun.txt.
# 7- Deletion of intermediate files.
# 8- Submission of the job.
