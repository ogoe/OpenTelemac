Trunk (Unreleased)
===========================

- STBTEL: Now refining the boundary conditions as well as the mesh
  Available through the script convertert.py as well
- Addons: Adding vim-syntax for .cas and .dico files
- TELEMAC-2D: change computation of wall distance (used in
  Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model). The wall distance (WDIST) is now
  computed in parallel with a laplacian operator.
- TELEMAC-2D: new framework for automatic convergence studies

Release V7P2R0 (31 Dec 2016)
===========================

Features
---------------------

- TELEMAC-2D: Add Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model.
- TelApy: Add the first structure for PYTHON API of TELEMAC.
- TELEMAC-3D: Add a new advection scheme (less diffusive scheme
  as in TELEMAC-2D).
- TELEMAC: Add possibility to prescribe space and time varying meteo
  conditions based on a file (ASCII ATMOSPHERIC DATA FILE and
  BINARY ATMOSPHERIC DATA FILE keywords).
- SISYPHE: Liquid boundaries file for bed load discharge.
- Replacing DredgeSim with Nestor.
- TELEMAC-2D: Add a new rainfall-runoff model. An example of use is given in
  the pluie test case.
- Automatic detection of Little/Big Endian for Serafin File
  (needs FORTRAN Gnu extension).
- TELEMAC-2D: Adding a deall_telemac2d subroutine that dallocates all that was
  allocated by point_telemac2d. Same thing for bief_all* and do on. This is
  mainly for API as in normal run the Fortran is cleaning on its own.
- TELEMAC-2D and 3D: new option for culvert modeling, change in the culvert parameters file.
- Adding NEWS file that contains the major modifications in the code.
- Integration of the MASCARET source code into the TELEMAC-MASCARET system
  (script mascaret.py to run code).
- TELEMAC-2D and 3D: possibility to read space-time varying meteo data from a
  binary file.
- TELEMAC-3D: possiblity to read space-time varying open boundary conditions
  from a binary file.

Addons
---------------------

- New version of ParaView plugin (SerafinReader) which allows to read Serafin
  file in Paraview.

Documentation
---------------------

- New developer guide in documentation/Misc/developer_guide.
- LaTeX documentation in folder documentation.
