% - Purpose & Description:
%     These first two parts give reader short details about the test case,
%     the physical phenomena involved, the geometry and specify how the numerical solution will be validated
%
\section{Purpose}
%
This test demonstrates the ability of \telemac{3d} to model the motion
of two fluids with different densities.
%
\section{Description}
%
A 30~m long and 1.2~m wide tank with a constant water depth of 4~m is
considered.
This tank contains two fluids at rest with different densities because
of their salinity:
1~g/L in the left half part and 0~g/L on the right part.
The flow is governed by density effects.
The heavy fluid sinks below the lighter one by forming a saline wedge
which, according to the observations, makes an angle of about $\pi/3$
with the bottom [2].\\
The simulation is done with and without the hydrostatic hypothesis.

\section{Results}
%
Figure \ref{t3d:lock-exchange:NH_res} presents the results obtained with
the non-hydrostatic version.

\begin{figure} [H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{../img/lock_exchange_NH_res.pdf}
 \caption{Lock exchange test: results from the non hydrostatic version}
 \label{t3d:lock-exchange:NH_res}
\end{figure}

The angle of $\pi/3$ between the front and the bottom is correctly
represented.\\
Considering that the whole potential energy of the initial conditions is
transformed into kinetic energy, it can be shown that the front velocity
is equal to 0.5 $\alpha$ where:
\begin{equation}
\alpha = \sqrt{g \frac{\rho_2-\rho_1}{\rho_2}h}
\end{equation}
The respective densities are $\rho_2$ = 1000.722~kg/m$^3$
and $\rho_1$ = 999.972~kg/m$^3$.
Then the theoretical velocity of the front is equal to 0.086~m/s.
The velocity computed by \telemac{3d} is approximately 0.07~m/s
(see figure \ref{t3d:lock-exchange:NH_res} where $\Delta x$ = 7~m
at $t$ = 100~s).
This underestimated result was predictable because the calculation is
started from a non-established situation with no velocity which makes
the calculation incorrect.\\
The results of the hydrostatic computation presented on figure
\ref{t3d:lock-exchange:hydro_res} show an average velocity of
approximately 0.065~m/s and an angle close to 90$^\circ$.

 \label{t3d:lock-exchange:hydro_res}
\end{figure}

This shows that the hydrostatic hypothesis is not valid for this type of
computation.

\section{Conclusion}
%
\telemac{3d} simulates correctly the motion of fluids with different
densities.
%
% Here is an example of how to include the graph generated by validateTELEMAC.py
