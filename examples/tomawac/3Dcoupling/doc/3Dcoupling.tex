\section{3D coupling}
%
% - Purpose & Problem description:
%     These first two parts give reader short details about the test case,
%     the physical phenomena involved and specify how the numerical solution will be validated
%
\subsection{Purpose}
%
This test case has been created to test the coupling between tomawac and Telemac3D.

%
\subsection{Description of the problem}
We took the geometry from the classical test case 'littoral', a coupling case between Tomawac and Telemac2D and Sisyphe
\subsection{Geometry and Mesh}
%
The beach is 1000 m long, 200 m wide
 The beach slope (Y=200m) is 5\%.
 The water depth along the open boundary (Y=0) is h=10m
We use a trianglular regular grid 

The mesh is as shown on Figure \ref{3Dcouplingmesh}
