\section{Triplets}
%
% - Purpose & Problem description:
%     These first two parts give reader short details about the test case,
%     the physical phenomena involved and specify how the numerical solution will be validated
%
\subsection{Purpose}
%
This test case has been created to test the extend the covering by using option of triad interactions that were not used in other cases.

%
\subsection{Description of the problem}
We simulate non linear transfers between triads. In the first case we use Lumped Triad Approximation model (LTA) and in the second case we use the SPB model
